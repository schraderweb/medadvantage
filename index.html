              Medicare Part D is prescription drug coverage. It helps cover
              costs for a wide range of prescription drugs and protects against
              higher costs.
            </h6>
            <h6 class="fw-300">
              If you have Medicare Parts A and B, you can add a Part D plan to
              existing coverage. Medicare Part C plans often have Part
              D/prescription drug benefits included.
